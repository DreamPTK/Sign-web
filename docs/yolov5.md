## What is YOLOv5
YOLOv5 is a prominent member of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series of computer vision models developed by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/), widely employed for object detection tasks in various applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and image understanding. YOLOv5 distinguishes itself with its efficiency and accuracy, providing real-time object detection capabilities [More](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/).

## YOLOv5 Architecture
Object detection, a use case for which YOLOv5 is designed, involves creating features from input images. These features are then fed through a prediction system to draw boxes around objects and predict their classes [More](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/object-detection-algorithm-yolo-v5-architecture-89e0a35472ef).
