<!-- ## Godream (Geo-dream)
Godream (Geo-dream) is a library that contain geospatial tools for RS&GIS analyze or geospatial analyze in python language. This appears to be a Python library specifically developed to assist in the analysis of geospatial data, with a focus on remote sensing and GIS applications. Such a library would likely provide functions and tools to manipulate, process, and visualize geospatial data, making it easier for users to perform complex analyses in these domains [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/Godream/).

[(How to create new environment)](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) -->

    mkdir sign_project
    cd sign_project
    python -m venv envName

### Activate your environment 

    envName\Scripts\activate.bat


<!-- ### Installation

    pip install ThTaxSigns -->


### Launch Visual Studio Code (VScode)

    code .

## In Visual Studio Code (VScode)

open new terminal (command line)
